What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden folder named .git which saves the history of my files.
I do this in order to have a history of my documents.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the place where I store logicallyy conneted files that are changed
and that I will want to commit together. Working directory tracks all my files in
the folder without separating them by logic. Repository keeps old versions of my
tracked and commited filed from which if I want I could revert back a commit.
